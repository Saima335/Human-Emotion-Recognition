# Face Emotion Detection Using FER-2013 Dataset and EfficientNet  

## Project Overview  
### Purpose  
This project implements a face emotion detection model using the FER-2013 dataset for training and evaluation. EfficientNet is leveraged for high-accuracy emotion classification while maintaining optimized computational efficiency. Deep learning techniques are applied to identify and classify multiple facial expressions.  

## Features  
- Face emotion classification using deep learning.  
- EfficientNet-based model for optimized accuracy and performance.  
- Trained on the FER-2013 dataset for diverse facial expressions.  

## Preprocessing Techniques  
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Converts images to grayscale for better feature extraction.  
- **Resizing**: Standardizes input image dimensions for EfficientNet.  
- **Normalization**: Scales pixel values for improved model training.  
- **Data Augmentation**: Applies transformations (flipping, rotation) to enhance model generalization.  

## Dataset  
- **FER-2013 Dataset**: A publicly available dataset containing 35,887 labeled facial images across seven emotion categories (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise).  

## Project Structure  
- **Colab Notebooks**: Model training, evaluation, and inference scripts.  
- **Dataset**: Preprocessed images from FER-2013.  
- **Models**: Fine-tuned EfficientNet models for emotion detection.  
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.  

## Research Questions  
- How does EfficientNet improve emotion classification accuracy?  
- What preprocessing techniques enhance facial expression recognition?  
- How can deep learning be optimized for real-time emotion detection?
